            <p>The vacuum tubes technology was used by the first generation of the computers, which was invented by Lee
              De Forest in 1906. The vacuum tube inventor named Lee De Forest, was an electrical engineer. For the
              memory and taking up the big rooms, the vacuum tubes were used on the first generation of a computer for
              the magnetic drums and the circuitry. It produced a large amount of heat and was very costly to operate;
              also, it consumed high electricity. During the first half of the 20th century, the vacuum tube was
              generally used to build a wide variety of other electronic devices, including televisions, radar, radios,
              and X-ray machines, as it was the fundamental technology. Additionally, this technology was also used with
              the computers made in the first generation. The below picture is an example of vacuum tubes.</p>

            <P>Second Generation of Computer During the late 1950s and 1960s, the interest in computer technology got fast, and the next generation of the computer, second, was introduced that replace vacuum tubes and used transistors. The computers made in the second generation were completely based upon transistors, not on vacuum tubes.</P>

            <P>The period of third generation was from 1965-1971. The computers of third generation used Integrated Circuits (ICs) in place of transistors. A single IC has many transistors, resistors, and capacitors along with the associated circuitry. The IC was invented by Jack Kilby. This development made computers smaller in size, reliable, and efficient.</P>

            <p>The period of the fourth generation was from 1971- 1980. The (VLSI) huge scale integrated circuits are used in the computers of this generation. These circuits have 5000 transistors and other circuit elements. The computers of the fourth-generation become more powerful, compact, reliable, and affordable.

              There are various advanced features such as time-sharing, real-time networks, distributed operating system were used in the fourth generation. All high-level language like C, C++, Java, PHP are used in this generation.
              
              These computers are also used in the LSI (large scale integration). The fourth generation is the extension of the third generation. The computer of the first generation filled the entire room space, but these computers can fit in the palm.

          <P>Fifth-generation computers were introduced after the fourth-generation computers were invented. Fifth-generation computers, also known as modern computers, are still in the development stage and are based on artificial intelligence. In 1982, Japan was invented the FGCS (Fifth Generation Computer System). </P>
